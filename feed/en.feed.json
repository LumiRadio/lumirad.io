      "content_html": "<p>Hello people of the world! For the past 5 months, ever since the YouTube stream went down, Lumi and I have been talking about what to do with the radio and how it will proceed. Pretty much from the get-go, we knew that a return to YouTube was going to be unlikely and that the radio had to change. Back then, I took it upon myself and had a working proof of concept ready within a day for a radio stream over Icecast (an audio stream server) and got working.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to today, where I can proudly announce that <strong>lumiRadio is real</strong>! I have worked long hours on this because I love the radio for the entertainment and the family it gave me and now I think it’s ready to release this to the public!</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-what-has-changed%3F\" tabindex=\"-1\">So what has changed? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#so-what-has-changed%3F\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"icon icon-tabler icon-tabler-link\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"currentColor\" fill=\"none\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\">\n  <path stroke=\"none\" d=\"M0 0h24v24H0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n  <path d=\"M10 14a3.5 3.5 0 0 0 5 0l4 -4a3.5 3.5 0 0 0 -5 -5l-.5 .5\" />\n  <path d=\"M14 10a3.5 3.5 0 0 0 -5 0l-4 4a3.5 3.5 0 0 0 5 5l.5 -.5\" />\n</svg>\n\n\n</a></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>The radio is now audio-only! This means there is no YouTube stream anymore, although there is still a chat!</li>\n<li>Byers is dead. Long live Byers. The old radio bot was not compatible with the radio in this form, so @Byers#0908 will take its’ place. Check the pinned comments for commands!\n<ul>\n<li>Also, the bot is using slash commands, except for fan favourite commands like !addcan.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Cans have been migrated from the old bot and Becbot over to the new bot as well!</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"how-do-i-listen-to-the-radio%3F\" tabindex=\"-1\">How do I listen to the radio? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#how-do-i-listen-to-the-radio%3F\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"icon icon-tabler icon-tabler-link\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"currentColor\" fill=\"none\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\">\n  <path stroke=\"none\" d=\"M0 0h24v24H0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n  <path d=\"M10 14a3.5 3.5 0 0 0 5 0l4 -4a3.5 3.5 0 0 0 -5 -5l-.5 .5\" />\n  <path d=\"M14 10a3.5 3.5 0 0 0 -5 0l-4 4a3.5 3.5 0 0 0 5 5l.5 -.5\" />\n</svg>\n\n\n</a></h2>\n<p>This depends on your device:</p>\n<p><strong>Windows/Mac/Linux:</strong> Download the VLC Media Player (or your favourite m3u-capable media player) and enter the stream URL and press Play! That’s all!<br>\n<strong>Android/iOS:</strong> Download TuneIn, go into your Library and press “Custom URL” and enter the stream URL. That’s it!</p>\n<p>You can also just open the stream link in your browser and that will work mostly!</p>\n<h2 id=\"so-what-now%3F\" tabindex=\"-1\">So what now? <a class=\"direct-link\" href=\"#so-what-now%3F\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" class=\"icon icon-tabler icon-tabler-link\" width=\"24\" height=\"24\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke=\"currentColor\" fill=\"none\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\">\n  <path stroke=\"none\" d=\"M0 0h24v24H0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n  <path d=\"M10 14a3.5 3.5 0 0 0 5 0l4 -4a3.5 3.5 0 0 0 -5 -5l-.5 .5\" />\n  <path d=\"M14 10a3.5 3.5 0 0 0 -5 0l-4 4a3.5 3.5 0 0 0 5 5l.5 -.5\" />\n</svg>\n\n\n</a></h2>\n<p>I am still working on the bot, ironing out bugs and taking suggestions for making it better. If you spot a bug or want to suggest something, please report/suggest over at the <a href=\"https://github.com/lumiRadio/lumiRadio\">GitHub page</a> or (if you’ve joined the Discord) <a href=\"https://canary.discord.com/channels/490000101331304448/1154117031944261772\">over here</a>!</p>\n<p>If you have any questions, please feel free to ask away!</p>\n<p>I hope you will enjoy the radio just as much as I do and I thank you for your patience! ❤️</p>\n",
